# README
[Classic Thesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis)を元にした学位論文用LaTeXテンプレートです。東京大学理学系研究科の博士論文様式に合うように調整しています。

This repository provides a LaTeX template for doctoral/master/bachelor theses, based on the [Classic Thesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) template and customized to meet the formatting requirements of the Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo.  This template is best suited for (but not limited to) astronomy and astrophysics theses.

## Features and Modifications

- **Bibliography Style**: Uses the MNRAS style for BibTeX references.
- **Japanese Language Support**: Partial support for Japanese text via the `CJKutf8` package.
- **Separate Abstract File**: Automatically generates an abstract PDF separate from the main thesis document.
- (**Footer Customization**: Includes a flipbook effect in the footer, just for fun.)

## Files to Edit
- `classicthesis-config.tex`: General configuration settings.
- `Thesis.tex`: The main thesis file.
- `FrontBackmatter/*.tex`: Content for the front and back matter, including the abstract and acknowledgments.
- `Chapters/*.tex`: Files for individual chapters.
- `mybib.bib`: BibTeX file.
